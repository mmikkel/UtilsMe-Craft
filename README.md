# Utilities Me! Craft CMS plugin v. 1.0

_Uncover the glory of the hidden Utilities CP section_

Utilities Me! grants easy access to Craft’s hidden _Utilities_ CP section, by adding all of its subpages to Craft's CP settings. Utilities Me! also provides a nifty _nav tab_, which can be hidden via the plugin settings if it annoys you.

## Installation and setup

* Download & unzip
* Move the /utilsme folder to craft/plugins
* Install from the Control Panel

### What is this “Utilities” section, anyway?

_The Utilities section_ is a hidden Control Panel area in Craft containing all sorts of useful information, including your logs, server and PHP info.

### Why does this plugin exist?

The Utilities section is quite useful, but manually typing /utils in the address bar is a chore.

### Options & settings

Annoyed by the nav tab? Rejoice, you can hide it via the plugin's settings.
